# TerminusDB Server v11.1.1-1 Release Notes

Very minor hotpatch release to include the new local dashboard.

## New

* New dashboard version (v6.0.9) which includes various fixes and enhancements, like the ability
  to properly close pull requests.

# TerminusDB Server v11.1.1 Release Notes

This release introduces a docker-compose deployment method which gets you all components of a fully-featured terminusdb setup:
* TerminusDB - the main database.
* VectorLink (experimental) - a database sidecar dedicated to storing, indexing and retrieving vectors by similarity, used for AI-enhanced search.
* terminusdb-change-request-api - an API for working with change requests.
* Terminusdb-dashboard - our dashboard for managing terminusdb, which now experimentally supports AI search and change requests.

Beyond that, this version brings various fixes and enhancements to our GraphQL support, our schema checking and migrations, and the document interface. Please read the detailed list below.

## Bug fixes
* multi-level graphql hierarchies were not always returning all objects.
* properties with prefixes didn't work properly in graphql.
* graphql reverse links did not work with sanitized names.
* graphql incorrectly filtered out 'id' from user-defined types.

## New

* docker-compose now comes bundled with vectorlink, local dashboard and pull request API.
* properties can now be inherited from multiple superclasses, and even redefined in a subclass, as long as they form a type-compatible hierarchy. The strictest form is actually applied. If the subclass defines a property that is not at least as strict as what was defined in the supers, this results in a schema error.
* graphql can now be made to not return subsumptions through the generated `include_children` argument.
* new environment variable `TERMINUSDB_TRUST_MIGRATIONS` will ensure that instance data is not re-checked when schemas change due to migrations, as migrations should in principle not result in any errors. As the migration feature is still relatively new, the default here is false, meaning that without this environment variable, all schema changes result in a recheck of all existing instance data. In the future, this default will likely change.

## Enhancements

* schema migration scripts now support changes to class hierarchies and key strategies.
* the graphql engine now keeps a small cache around of recent schemas to speed up repeated queries.

## Experimental

* graphql filters now support deep matches on IDs.
* document API has a new parameter `ids` on GET allowing you to submit a list of documents to retrieve at once.

# TerminusDB Server v11.1.0 Release Notes

## Bug fixes

* Fix ordering of graphql stringy numbers
* Adding type information to decimals
* Adding a correct diff using out of band value
* Prevent reserved words in GraphQL from being used
* Fix loading of triples

## New

* Add support for the TerminusDB semantic indexer for AI search capabilities
* Add ability to merge base layers with the `concat` command

## Enhancement

* Reduced memory usage
* Remove Google Analytics in Dashboard

# TerminusDB Server v11.0.6 Release Notes

## Bug fixes
* Unused optional properties would cause GraphQL to fail
* Enums were not working properly for collection types in GraphQL
* Incorrect version checking on system graphs caused superfluous graph updates on startup
* Modifications of classes with `@oneOf` would leave stale objects in the schema graph
* Diffing sets now works
* Fix error reporting when pushing nonexistent remotes
* GraphQL did not work properly with `@oneOf` properties
* Memory leak in document API
* Crash when processing several compressed requests in the same session

## New
* On schema modifications, a migration will be inferred when possible.
* New options added to document interface
** `allow_destructive_migration`: Allow for inference of migrations that will also modify instance data. If set, the schema modification will also automatically transform any instance objects already in the database.
** `require_migration`: This will cause the request to fail for schema changes for which no migration can be inferred.

## Enhancement
* diff endpoint now has `start` and `count` options for paged results
* Improve memory footprint when retrieving lots of documents through the document API
* Support JSON objects in GraphQL

# TerminusDB Server v11.0.5 Release Notes
## Bug fixes

# TerminusDB Server v11.0.4 Release Notes
## New

* Support updating a schema from a target branch as long as there is a migration

# TerminusDB Server v11.0.3 Release Notes

## Bug fixes

* Prevent early failure on full schema replace where id is missing
* Support stringy filters on all stringy types, not just strings
* Return 204 on doc delete (and disable chunking for non-gets)
* Fix inversion naming issue. This causes issues when using non-standard GraphQL class names

## New

# TerminusDB Server v11.0.2 Release Notes

## Bug fixes
* On replace, schema documentation entities were not cleaned up properly
* Fix support for ne (not equal) operator in graphql

# TerminusDB Server v11.0.1 Release Notes

## Backwards-incompatible changes
* Document replacement allowed insertion of nested documents, even
  without the create option specified. We decided that this was a bug,
  and made it so that this now errors, unless the create option is
  specified. This is backwards-incompatible, but we believe that this
  is the correct behavior. If your code relies on nested documents
  being inserted, make sure you specify the create option. Note that
  this is just about nested documents which are top-level
  types. Subdocuments are not affected.

## New

* Introduced support for a grpc label store as an alternative to file-based label lookup [terminusdb-labs/terminusdb-grpc-labelstore](https://github.com/terminusdb-labs/terminusdb-grpc-labelstore)
* Implemented local clone
* Implement user impersionation in the CLI tool

* Fix SSL issues in fetch and push: newer version of openssl errors when a connection is closed unexpectedly
* Fix accidental insertion of duplicate nested documents
* Fixed GYear support

# TerminusDB Server v11.0.0 Release Notes

## Backwards-Incompatible Changes

* This release changes the storage format of TerminusDB. After
  installing this version, you will also need to upgrade your storage
  directory, or the server will not start. A conversion tool is
  provided at
  [terminusdb-10-to-11](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-10-to-11). This
  is also bundled with
  [terminusdb-bootstrap](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-bootstrap).
* TerminusDB 11 now responds to `xsd:integer`, `xsd:decimal`, and all
  of the unbounded sub-types of these two objects in the document
  interface with strings. This is because many (even most) JSON
  libraries can not handle arbitrary precision integers, and (few if
  any) can handle arbitrary precision floats. It should still be
  possible to submit documents using integers or floats, but when
  returned they will be strings.

## Enhancements

* New Storage backend
  - Added typed storage for a wide variety of XSD types, reducing
    storage overhead and improving search performance
  - Introduce a layer archive format reducing storage use and latency
    and simplifying interchange.
* GraphQL `_type` added to objects to return the exact rather than subsumed type
* Added `@unfoldable` document flag to frames
* Add `@metadata` to frames

# TerminusDB Server v3.0.7 Release Notes

## Bug fixes

+ Fix Windows tray icon error bug

# TerminusDB Server v3.0.6 Release Notes

## Bug fixes

+ Fix subject-object iterator

# TerminusDB Server v3.0.5 Release Notes

This is a feature and bugfix release

## New

+ Add tabling and compilation of schema definitions for faster document access
+ Speed improvements to literal marshalling

## Bug fixes

+ Fix long standing reporting issue on missing classes
+ Increased default stack-size because large packs are stack allocated and can cause stack-overflow on small stacks.
+ Improved determinism in frame code.

# TerminusDB Server v3.0.3 Release Notes

This is a feature and bugfix release

## New

+ Added reverse path queries allowing backwards follow in graph regular expressions for path
+ New word "immediately" which does non-backtracking side-effects
+ Force flag now allows database deletion to work even when database is not finalised
+ Expose additions and removals (deltas) to the WOQL query API

## Bug fixes

+ Add proper handling for rdf:langString

# TerminusDB Server v3.0.0 Release Notes

This is our TerminusDB Server v3 liberation release. We have removed
the masters from our default branching.

## New

+ Reset API allows reseting branch to arbitrary commit
+ Squash API operation now available
+ Default branch is now called main and not master
+ Added much more extensive coverage of API in the api.owl.ttl ontology
+ Fixed some schema errors in woql.owl.ttl
+ Added boolean flag (`all_witnesses`) for returning all or only the first witness from schema checks.
+ Improvements to schema checking. Most large inserts with schema will be 40% faster

## Backwards-Incompatible Changes

+ Default branch will be set to main and not master, so that some
  calls which relied on master being default will fail. This can be
  fixed in all cases by doing a branch operation from master to main.
+ By default only one witness is now returned in WOQL queries in which
  the resulting database violates schema constraints.

## Bug fixes

+ Improved the API for organisation management
+ Improved CORS handling on some calls

# TerminusDB Server v2.0.6 Release Notes

This is largely a bug fix and cleanup release. We focused on improving error handling and code maintanability.

## New

+ Better overall error handling.
+ Extended create db API to allow users to specify whether they want a schema or not.
+ Improved JWT handling for authentication.
+ Added API for role and organisation creation.
+ Extensive work on making capability checking more robust.
+ First draft of auto-generating `.md` files from loaded ontologies.
+ Turtle files can now be read with WOQL.get using "by order of"
  parameter list with three elements.
+ Posted files can now be processed by WOQL.get

## Changes

+ Fixed API endpoint for WOQL.put which allows us to dump to CSV

## Backwards-Incompatible Changes

+ Errors are now largely structured as JSON-LD carrying with them a type which
  is defined in `terminus-schema/api.owl.ttl`. This should make it much easier
  for clients to determine the exact meaning of an error, and allows Error reporting
  to be documented in an ontology.

## Bug fixes

+ Handling of floating point numbers has been improved to stop some spurious type errors.
+ Fixed a utf-8 encoding issue encountered when loading remote csvs.


# TerminusDB Server v2.0.5 Release Notes

## Changes

+ New TerminusDB Console
+ Bug fixes

# TerminusDB Server v2.0.4 Release Notes

## Changes

+ New version of terminusdb-console

# TerminusDB Server v2.0.3 Release Notes

## New

+ Implemented Clone, Push and Pull

## Changes

+ The `TERMINUSDB_SERVER_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable is now ignored. TerminusDB is now fully location-agnostic.
+ Added `TERMINUSDB_SERVER_PACK_DIR` environment variable, determining where swi-prolog packages will be installed.
  This was added to make it easier to offer alternative distributions of TerminusDB in the future.

## Bug fixes

+ CORS handling has been changed to reflect Origin on authenticated requests.

# TerminusDB Server v2.0.2 Release Notes

## New

+ Provide HTTPS support and the ability to set your own certs

## Bug fixes

+ The built-in web console now works on different hosts

# TerminusDB Server v2.0.1 Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

+ Resolution of resource descriptors now attempts to resolve relative
  to the current context before trying to resolve as an absolute path.
+ woql:Size was using a database path predicate which was not imported
  causing it to fail.

# TerminusDB Server v2.0.0 Release Notes

## New

TerminusDB Server now implements databases as a tiered structure which
tracks deltas on collections of graphs. This tiered structure
includes:

+ Meta data graph: Holds information about the local and all remote
  repositories assocated with a given database.
+ Commit Graph: A graph containing information about all commits,
  their authors, a comment, and associated branches.
+ Instance and Schema Graphs: These graphs containing the actual data.

These new structural changes to the underlying store allow users to
perform a number of git-like operations. This includes:

+ Time-travel on databases: You can run queries, browse documents or
  view the schema at any previous commit.
+ Branching: You can branch from any current branch or reference (a
  previous commit).

Several new querying capabilities have been added:

+ Regular path queries allowing the user to query recursively using
  combinations of intermediate predicates resulting in both end-point
  nodes and the particular path as a list of edge objects.
+ Database size and triple count can be queried
+ You can choose a specific resource to query including: the meta-data
  graph, the commit graph, a collection of instance or schema graphs,
  or a particular commit.

## Backwards-Incompatible Changes

+ The storage approach has changed dramatically and so previous
  databases can not be read directly by the new TerminusDB. Upgrades
  require re-ingesting data.

+ The previous version of TerminusDB used JSON as an interchange for
  WOQL ASTs. The current version uses JSON-LD, which is a
  serialisation of RDF. This enables us to store WOQL queries in a
  database and provides a schema documentation of the WOQL query language.

## Bug Fixes

+ Transactional logic in TerminusDB 1.0 had surprising outcomes when
  backtracking over inserts. We currently treat inserts as
  non-backtracking destructive updates.
+ WOQL.when is not required in order to perform updates.
