## How To Guide

How To Guides are problem driven and are designed to be a source of quick information in ‘doing mode’ when working with TerminusDB. Things like 'How Do I Set Up A Remote from TerminusDB'

The idea is to provide a series of steps with a focus on the goal (getting something done!). They should address a particular problem and have no unnecessary explanation. Practical usability and not completeness is key. How Tos will not give you everything, they are like a recipe that you can alter according to your need or taste.

We use the ['The Diátaxis documentation system'](https://diataxis.fr/) to organise the TerminusDB docs.
